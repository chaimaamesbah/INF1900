# Embedded System Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the collaborative development of a hardware and software system based on a microcontroller board. The technical concepts covered in this project include understanding both hardware and software elements, as well as the interactions required to build and comprehend a simple yet complete computer system with inputs, outputs, and peripherals.

## Key Concepts and Objectives

The project introduces the following concepts:

1. **Familiarization with Hardware and Software**  
   Learn the essential components of a microcontroller-based system, including how to interface with peripherals and handle input/output operations.

2. **Programming at Different Levels**  
   Explore programming at both low and high levels to control the system. This includes writing embedded C code for direct control of hardware, and potentially higher-level code for interfacing with the system.

3. **Configuration Management**  
   Implement configuration management practices to organize project files, maintain different versions of the system, and ensure smooth collaboration in a team environment.

4. **Code Inspections and Testing**  
   Introduce methods for code review and testing to ensure the reliability and performance of the system. Testing will cover both unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the entire system.

5. **Best Practices in Programming**  
   Gradually introduce core programming practices, such as code structure, readability, maintainability, and the use of version control systems like Git for managing source code.

## System Components

- **Microcontroller Board**: The core of the system, handling inputs, outputs, and communication with peripherals.
- **Input/Output Devices**: Includes sensors, buttons, LEDs, and other devices to interact with the system.
- **Peripherals**: External devices connected to the microcontroller for additional functionality, such as communication interfaces or motor control.

## Project Goals

- Develop a fully functioning embedded system that integrates both hardware and software components.
- Ensure that the system is capable of interacting with its environment through various inputs and outputs.
- Apply theoretical knowledge to practical, hands-on development in embedded systems.
